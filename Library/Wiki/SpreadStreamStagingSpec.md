# 🗂️ Coinductive Spread Stream Deforestation 2LTT Staging Specification

Documents and verifies the formal application of **Two-Level Type Theory (2LTT) Staged Compilation** (Kovács 2022) to **Coinductive Spread Polynumber Streams & Goh Factors** within the multiset transformation kernel.

## 1. Mathematical Foundation

1. **Coinductive Spread Polynomial Stream (`SpreadStream`)**:
   Represents rational trigonometric spread polynumbers $S(n)$ and Goh multiset factor bags ($\Phi_k(s)$) generated over discrete divisors.

2. **Stage 1 ($\mathcal{U}_1$) Meta-Level / Compile-Time Stage**:
   Represented by `StrictLevel GohMultiset`. Meta-level computations evaluate divisor factorizations ($\text{divisors}(n)$), Gauss's totient identity ($\sum_{d|n} \phi(d) = n$), and deforested hylomorphic stream folds (`fusedSpreadHylomorphism`) under zero heap allocations.

3. **Stage 0 ($\mathcal{U}_0$) Object-Level / Runtime Stage**:
   Represented by `HomotopyLevel GohMultiset`. Object-level terms represent physical chromogeometric budget allocations across Blue (Elliptic), Red (Hyperbolic), and Green (Parabolic) sectors (`chromogeometricBudgetExhaustion`).

4. **Zero-Heap Stream Deforestation (`Skip` / `Yield`)**:
   `FusedStream GohMultiset` uses `Skip` and `Yield` stream constructors to eliminate intermediate list allocations during compile-time staging, delivering pure, un-staged rational trig steps at runtime.

> **Multiset Perspective**: SpreadStream staging evaluates divisor factorizations and stream hylomorphisms at compile time (Stage 1), deforesting stream allocations so that runtime execution (Stage 0) receives zero-drift rational trig steps without heap overhead.
